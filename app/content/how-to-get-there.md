    <h3>Getting to The Scottish Borders</h3>
    <p>
      The Scottish Borders is a rural part of southern Scotland and as such there is no reliable public transportation.  You will need to have a car!  We'll be arriving in the area on Wednesday, 13<sup>th</sup> May so if you're arriving early we'd love to see you!
    </p>

    <h3>Flying in</h3>
    <h4>Nearest Airports</h4>
    <ul class="list">

      <li><a href="http://www.newcastleairport.com/" rel="external">Newcastle</a>, England: approximately 1.5 hours south of the area, with 24 hour car hire and return facilities.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Note that the drive from the London area is approximately 6-7 hours (without traffic).</p>
  
    <h3>Arriving by Train</h3>
    <p>For those traveling up from London there are several easy train options. Please note that car hire facilities are fewer and there are no options for picking up a car on a Sunday (though you can drop off) and the hours they are open for pick-up are more limited.</p>

    <p>The closest stations are Carlisle and Berwick-Upon-Tweed (both about an hours drive to Selkirk).</p>

    <h3>Transportation to the ceremony and reception</h3>
    <p>Aikwood Tower itself is down a quiet farm lane with extremely limited parking.  We will be asking guests not to drive to the tower on the day and we will be providing minibus taxi shuttle service from nearby hotels. This means that you will not need to worry about a designated driver on the day!  It does mean that if you are staying very far away we might ask you to drop your car at a nearby hotel to jump on the minivan.</p>

    <p>If you must drive to the wedding on the day please let us know so we can accommodate you.  Please note that motorcycles are not exempt from this request (Kiril).</p>
