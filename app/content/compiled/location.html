    <p>Aikwood Tower is 4 miles from Selkirk in the Scottish Borders. Built in 1535 as a tower house for a working family it was abandoned in the 18th century. Following renovation in the 1990s it was initially a family home before finding it&#39;s principal attraction as a holiday retreat or, of course, a fabulous venue for getting married!</p>
